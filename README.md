## Design Improvements
The frontend challenge was fairly and I tried to design a UI that would be simple to use. This year I kept my code very modular and I didn't really run into any issues. The hardest part of this challenge was trying to figure out a design that looked nice and and was intuitive. I guess this is why we have designers. I think my final design was pretty nice overall considering I built it from scratch but I did take some inspiration color wise from last year's website. I did leave 2 warning of unused components but that's not too big. This app was designed to scale for all screen sizes greater than the Iphone SE. I'm again pretty happy with the design and there were some more functionality I could have implemented but hopefully I will have that opportunity next year on the CruzHacks dev team.
